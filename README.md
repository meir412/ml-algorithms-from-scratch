## Machine learning algorithms from scratch

* This repository contains my implementations of different ml algorithms in python.
* The scripts containing the algorithm will usually also contain experiments testing the algorithm on sampled or 
downloaded data.
* I usually use the `numpy` package for vectorization and efficient mathematical operators.
* I sometimes use the `matplotlib` package for visualization of the experiments.
